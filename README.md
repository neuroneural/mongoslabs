# mongoslabs
Dataloader that serves MRI images from a mongodb.

The main idea is to keep MRI images and corresponding training labels
for segmentation tasks in a `mongo` database. However, each 256<sup>3</sup> 3D MRI
tensor even in 8 bit precision is 16Mb. `mongo`'s records cannot be
larger than this limit and we need to also store the labels of the
same dimensions. `mongoslabs` fetches and aggregates each 256<sup>3</sup>
tensor stored across 8 records, together with corresponding labels
either for gray and white matter, 104 regions atlas, or a 50 region
atlas. (The scripts to populate such collection are upcoming.)

An example of maintaining a high utilization on 4 GPUs

# installation
```
pip install mongoslabs
```
# usage
A detailed example of how to create a dataloader using provided
dataset class and the corresponding tools is in
`scripts/usage_example.py`

Do not forget to move the batches to the GPU once obtained.
